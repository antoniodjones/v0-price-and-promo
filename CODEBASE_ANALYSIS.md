# GTI Pricing Engine - Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

## **Current Architecture Overview**

Your GTI Pricing Engine is already a sophisticated, enterprise-grade cannabis retail pricing and promotion management system.

### **✅ Existing Strengths**

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation with entities, repositories, and services
- **Comprehensive Database Schema**: Products, customers, pricing, promotions, analytics
- **Advanced Pricing Logic**: Multi-tier discounts, expiration rules, THC-based pricing
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: 50+ API endpoints, authentication, admin dashboard
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support, live price tracking, inventory alerts
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Advanced dashboards, performance metrics, ROI analysis

### **Key Business Logic Implemented**

- **Smart Discount Engine**: Customer tier (A/B/C), expiration-based, THC-level, volume discounts
- **Cannabis-Specific Features**: THC percentage tracking, batch management, compliance
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitor pricing, market trends, demand forecasting
- **Revenue Optimization**: Margin analysis, price elasticity, scenario planning

## **Systematic Refactoring Plan**

### **Critical Issues Identified**
- ❌ CSS Import Conflicts with `tw-animate-css` dependency causing crashes
- ❌ Preview not loading (blank white page)
- ❌ Massive codebase complexity (393+ files)
- ❌ Mixed patterns and inconsistent architecture
- ❌ Database over-engineering

### **7-Step Refactoring Progress**

#### **✅ Task 1: Fix Core Infrastructure Issues**
- [x] Removed problematic `tailwindcss-animate` dependency
- [x] Fixed CSS import conflicts
- [x] Simplified font loading with proper Next.js patterns
- [x] Created minimal working foundation
- [x] Resolved `toLowerCase()` errors in CSS processing

#### **🔄 Task 2: Clean Architecture Foundation** (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Established core types and interfaces
- [x] Created clean service layer structure
- [x] Implemented base repository pattern
- [x] Defined use cases for business logic
- [x] Set up centralized configuration
- [ ] Verify preview is working
- [ ] Complete architecture cleanup

#### **⏳ Task 3: Atomic Design Components**
- [ ] Create atomic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- [ ] Build molecular components (forms, modals, tables)
- [ ] Develop organism components (headers, sidebars, dashboards)
- [ ] Implement template layouts
- [ ] Create page compositions

#### **⏳ Task 4: Domain-Driven Database**
- [ ] Simplify database schema
- [ ] Optimize entity relationships
- [ ] Implement proper migrations
- [ ] Add data validation layers
- [ ] Create repository abstractions

#### **⏳ Task 5: Unified State Management**
- [ ] Implement consistent state patterns
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Create loading states
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates
- [ ] Add state persistence

#### **⏳ Task 6: Error Handling & Logging**
- [ ] Implement global error handling
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Create error reporting
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement health checks

#### **⏳ Task 7: Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies

## **Current Status**

**Last Updated**: Current Session
**Current Task**: Clean Architecture Foundation
