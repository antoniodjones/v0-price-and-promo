# Refactoring Plan - GTI Pricing Engine

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic refactoring plan to address technical debt, improve code quality, and ensure clean Vercel deployments.

## Current State Assessment

- **Total Lines of Code**: 50,000+
- **Total Files**: 567+
- **Last Major Refactor**: Never (continuous development)
- **Technical Debt Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Deployment Readiness**: 80%

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Dependency Management (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: `tiny-invariant` ESM CDN parse error  
**Root Cause**: Version conflicts between explicit and transitive dependencies  
**Impact**: Blocks preview and testing

**Action Plan**:
- [x] Remove explicit `tiny-invariant` from package.json
- [ ] Audit all dependencies for version conflicts
- [ ] Lock dependency versions for production stability
- [ ] Test ESM CDN resolution

**Timeline**: Immediate (Week 1)

### 2. Build Configuration (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: TypeScript/ESLint errors will fail production builds  
**Root Cause**: Development-only error ignoring in next.config.mjs  
**Impact**: Production deployment failures

**Action Plan**:
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript errors
- [ ] Fix all ESLint errors
- [ ] Remove `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` flags
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for type checking

**Timeline**: Week 1-2

### 3. Deployment Configuration (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Missing production deployment configuration  
**Root Cause**: No vercel.json or .env.example  
**Impact**: Difficult deployments, missing environment variables

**Action Plan**:
- [x] Create `vercel.json` with build configuration
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all required variables
- [x] Create `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Document deployment process

**Timeline**: Week 1

### 4. Code Organization (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Some components exceed clean code guidelines  
**Root Cause**: Rapid feature development without refactoring cycles  
**Impact**: Maintainability and readability

**Action Plan**:
- [ ] Identify files > 300 lines
- [ ] Identify functions > 50 lines
- [ ] Extract reusable utilities
- [ ] Simplify complex conditionals
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to public APIs

**Timeline**: Weeks 2-4

### 5. Testing Infrastructure (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Only 60% test coverage  
**Root Cause**: Testing added after feature development  
**Impact**: Risk of bugs in production

**Action Plan**:
- [ ] Complete basket testing interface
- [ ] Add pricing engine unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with test gates

**Timeline**: Weeks 2-4

## Refactoring Principles

Following DESIGN_DECISIONS.md Clean Code principles:

### 1. Function Design
- **Target**: Functions < 50 lines
- **Current**: Some functions 100+ lines
- **Action**: Extract methods, simplify logic

### 2. File Size
- **Target**: Files < 300 lines
- **Current**: Some files 400+ lines
- **Action**: Split into smaller modules

### 3. Naming Conventions
- **Target**: Intention-revealing names
- **Current**: Mostly good, some abbreviations
- **Action**: Rename unclear variables/functions

### 4. Code Duplication
- **Target**: DRY principle
- **Current**: Some duplication in wizards
- **Action**: Extract common wizard logic

### 5. Type Safety
- **Target**: No `any` types
- **Current**: Minimal `any` usage
- **Action**: Replace remaining `any` with proper types

## Refactoring Schedule

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
- [x] Fix `tiny-invariant` dependency issue
- [x] Create deployment configuration files
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors
- [ ] Fix ESLint errors
- [ ] Test local build

### Week 2: Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor large files (>300 lines)
- [ ] Refactor long functions (>50 lines)
- [ ] Extract common utilities
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
- [ ] Simplify complex conditionals

### Week 3: Testing
- [ ] Complete basket testing interface
- [ ] Add pricing engine tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add E2E tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Week 4: Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Add query result caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Add error tracking
- [ ] Load testing

## Success Criteria

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All ESLint errors resolved
- [ ] No files > 300 lines
- [ ] No functions > 50 lines
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%

### Deployment Metrics
- [ ] Clean local build
- [ ] Clean Vercel preview build
- [ ] Clean production build
- [ ] Build time < 5 minutes
- [ ] No deployment errors

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Pricing calculations < 200ms
- [ ] API responses < 500ms
- [ ] Page load times < 2s
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Database queries optimized

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**: Refactoring may introduce bugs
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Business needs features quickly
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited development time
4. **Testing Gaps**: Incomplete test coverage

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Refactoring**: Small, safe changes
2. **Feature Freeze**: Pause new features during refactor
3. **Automated Testing**: Catch regressions early
4. **Code Review**: Peer review all changes
5. **Rollback Plan**: Easy revert if issues arise

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Daily standups, code reviews
- **Business Owners**: Weekly progress updates
- **QA Team**: Test plan coordination
- **DevOps**: Deployment coordination

### Status Reporting
- **Daily**: Slack updates on progress
- **Weekly**: Written status report
- **Bi-weekly**: Demo of improvements
- **Monthly**: Metrics dashboard review

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan addresses critical technical debt while maintaining business value delivery. By following Clean Code principles from DESIGN_DECISIONS.md and focusing on deployment readiness, we'll create a more maintainable, testable, and deployable codebase.

**Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks  
**Estimated Effort**: 160 hours  
**Expected Outcome**: Production-ready, maintainable codebase with 80%+ test coverage
