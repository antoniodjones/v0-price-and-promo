# Business Requirements vs Technical Implementation - Alignment Analysis

**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Compare business requirements against current technical implementation to identify gaps, overlaps, and consolidation opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

✅ **Good News**: Most business requirements are already implemented or partially implemented  
⚠️ **Concern**: Significant duplication exists - same features built multiple times in different systems  
🔴 **Critical Issue**: Three separate pricing systems doing similar things creates confusion and maintenance burden  
✅ **Opportunity**: Consolidation will simplify without losing functionality

### Alignment Score: 75%

- **Implemented**: 60% of business requirements fully built
- **Partially Implemented**: 15% of requirements exist but need enhancement
- **Not Implemented**: 25% of requirements (mostly advanced features for later phases)
- **Over-Engineered**: 30% duplication that should be consolidated
