## Epic 1: Base Pricing Management

### User Story 1.1: Product Base Pricing Configuration

**As a** pricing manager  
**I want to** configure base prices for products with effective date ranges  
**So that** wholesale customers see accurate pricing across all order touchpoints

#### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Product Base Pricing Configuration

Background:
  Given I am logged in as a pricing manager
  And I have access to the pricing configuration module

Scenario: Create new base price for a product
  Given I navigate to the product pricing page
  When I select product "Premium Flower - Blue Dream - 1oz"
  And I enter base price "$240.00"
  And I set effective start date to "2025-10-01"
  And I set effective end date to "2025-12-31"
  And I click "Save"
  Then the base price should be saved successfully
  And the system should display confirmation "Base price created successfully"
  And the price should be active on the effective start date

Scenario: Update existing base price
  Given product "Premium Flower - Blue Dream - 1oz" has base price "$240.00"
  When I update the base price to "$250.00"
  And I set new effective start date to "2025-11-01"
  Then the system should create a new price record
  And the old price should remain active until "2025-10-31"
  And the new price should activate on "2025-11-01"

Scenario: Price validation rules
  Given I am creating a base price for a product
  When I enter an invalid price format "ABC"
  Then the system should display error "Price must be a valid monetary amount"
  And the save button should be disabled
