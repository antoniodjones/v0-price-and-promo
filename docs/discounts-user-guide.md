## Discount Stacking

### Stacking Rules

Control how multiple discounts combine:

**No Stacking** (Default):

- System automatically selects best discount for customer
- Simplest and most common approach

**Additive Stacking**:
- Multiple discounts add together
- Example: 10% + 5% = 15% total
- Can significantly impact margins

**Multiplicative Stacking**:
- Discounts multiply
- Example: 10% then 5% = 14.5% total (not 15%)
- More conservative than additive

### Configuring Stacking

1. **Navigate to Settings** â†’ Discount Settings
2. **Select Stacking Method**:
   - No stacking (recommended)
   - Additive stacking
   - Multiplicative stacking
3. **Set Maximum Discount**: Cap total discount percentage
4. **Define Priority**:
   - Customer-specific discounts first
   - Promotional discounts second
   - Automatic discounts last
5. **Save Configuration**

### Best Discount Selection

When stacking is disabled, system selects best discount:

1. **Calculate Each Discount**: Determine final price with each discount
2. **Compare Results**: Find lowest final price
3. **Apply Best**: Use discount that saves customer most
4. **Display**: Show which discount was applied
