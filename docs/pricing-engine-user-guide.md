## Overview

The Pricing Engine is the core system that calculates final prices for all products across all channels and markets. It combines base prices, market adjustments, promotions, and dynamic rules to deliver optimal pricing in real-time.

### Key Features

- **Base Price Management**: Set foundation prices for all products
- **Market Pricing**: Adjust prices by location or sales channel
- **Dynamic Rules**: Automated pricing based on inventory, competition, time
- **Promotion Integration**: Seamlessly applies discounts and offers
- **Price Testing**: A/B test different pricing strategies
- **Analytics**: Track pricing performance and elasticity

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Pricing Engine

1. **Navigate to Pricing Engine**: Click "Pricing Engine" in the left sidebar
2. **Dashboard View**: See pricing overview with:
   - Total products with pricing
   - Active pricing rules
   - Average margin
   - Recent price changes

### Understanding Price Calculation

The final price is calculated in this order:

1. **Base Price**: Starting price for the product
2. **Market Adjustment**: Location or channel-specific adjustment
3. **Dynamic Rules**: Automated adjustments (inventory, time, competition)
4. **Promotions**: Customer-specific or general discounts
5. **Final Price**: Price shown to customer

**Example**:
\`\`\`
Base Price: $50.00
Market Adjustment: +10% (California) = $55.00
Dynamic Rule: -5% (high inventory) = $52.25
Promotion: -20% (customer tier A) = $41.80
Final Price: $41.80
\`\`\`
