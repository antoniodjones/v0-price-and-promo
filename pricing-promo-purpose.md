# Pricing vs Promotions: Strategic Framework

## Core Distinction

**Pricing** refers to the permanent or standard cost structure for products or services. It's the baseline amount customers pay and reflects factors like production costs, market positioning, competitor analysis, and desired profit margins. Pricing is typically more stable and strategic, establishing where a brand sits in the market hierarchy. For example, a luxury brand maintains consistently high prices to reinforce its premium positioning, while a value retailer keeps prices low as part of its core identity.

**Promotions** are temporary price reductions or special offers designed to drive immediate sales, clear inventory, attract new customers, or respond to competitive pressures. These include discounts, coupons, buy-one-get-one deals, seasonal sales, and limited-time offers. Promotions are tactical tools that create urgency and can help businesses achieve short-term objectives without permanently altering their pricing structure.

## Key Differences

The key differences lie in **duration**, **purpose**, and **strategic impact**:

- **Pricing** establishes long-term market position and sustainable revenue
- **Promotions** provide flexibility to respond to market conditions and drive specific behaviors

Effective businesses use pricing to communicate their value proposition consistently, then layer promotions on top to create excitement and accelerate purchase decisions when needed.

## Strategic Balance

However, overusing promotions can undermine pricing strategy by training customers to wait for deals or devaluing the brand's perceived worth. The most successful companies find the right balance between maintaining price integrity and using promotional tactics strategically.

## Application to GTI Pricing Engine

In the GTI Pricing Engine context:

### Pricing Systems (Permanent/Strategic)
- **Customer Tier Pricing** - Permanent pricing structures based on customer relationships (A/B/C tiers)
- **Volume Pricing** - Standing discounts for quantity purchases (wholesale, bulk)
- **Market Pricing** - Geographic market-based pricing strategies
- **Base Product Pricing** - Core product cost structures

### Promotion Systems (Temporary/Tactical)
- **BOGO Promotions** - Limited-time buy-one-get-one offers
- **Bundle Deals** - Temporary multi-product bundles
- **Seasonal Promotions** - Holiday or event-based campaigns
- **Clearance Promotions** - Inventory-driven temporary discounts
- **Promo Codes** - Campaign-specific discount codes

The system must maintain clear separation between these two concepts while allowing them to work together through a unified pricing calculation engine.
