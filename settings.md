# System Administration Settings - Pricing & Promotions Engine

## Business Context
This pricing and promotions engine is designed for a B2B cannabis manufacturer that sells products to external and internal cannabis dispensaries as part of their wholesale division. The system will integrate with or serve as a module within an order-to-cash platform.

## Guiding Principles for System Administration

For a pricing and promotions engine that needs to be 90-100% self-configurable, we recommend a multi-tiered approach with "Administration" as the main hub, since it better conveys the business management nature of the configurations rather than just technical settings.

## Administration Hub Structure

### Pricing Configuration
- **Price Lists Management**: Create and manage multiple price lists for different customer segments, regions, or channels
- **Pricing Rules Engine**: Visual rule builder for complex pricing logic (if customer type = wholesale AND volume > 100 units, then apply 15% discount)
- **Cost Management**: Input and update product costs, markup rules, and margin requirements
- **Currency & Localization**: Configure exchange rates, regional pricing adjustments, and tax implications
- **Approval Workflows**: Define who can approve pricing changes at different thresholds

### Promotions Configuration
- **Campaign Templates**: Pre-built promotion types that business users can customize (BOGO, percentage off, tiered discounts)
- **Promotion Rules Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex promotional logic and eligibility criteria
- **Customer Segmentation**: Define and manage customer groups for targeted promotions
- **Channel Settings**: Configure which promotions apply to which sales channels
- **Budget & Limits Management**: Set spending caps, usage limits, and promotional budgets

### Customer & Account Management
- **Customer Hierarchies**: Set up parent-child account relationships and inheritance rules
- **Contract Templates**: Define standard contract terms and pricing structures
- **Credit & Payment Terms**: Configure payment terms, credit limits, and approval processes
- **Account-Specific Overrides**: Manage customer-specific pricing exceptions and special terms

### Integration & System Settings
- **API Configuration**: Manage external system connections and data sync rules
- **User Roles & Permissions**: Define what different user types can access and modify
- **Audit & Compliance**: Configure logging, approval trails, and regulatory reporting
- **Business Calendar**: Set up fiscal periods, seasonal adjustments, and promotional calendars

## Instructions for Development Team

Build the system with a configuration-driven architecture where:

### Rule Engine Foundation
Create a flexible rules engine that can interpret JSON-based configuration files rather than hard-coded business logic

### Visual Configuration Tools
Implement drag-and-drop interfaces for building pricing and promotional rules without coding

### Template System
Build reusable templates for common scenarios that business users can clone and modify

### Validation Framework
Create configurable validation rules that prevent invalid configurations

### Preview & Testing Environment
Include sandbox capabilities where users can test configurations before deploying

### Version Control
Implement configuration versioning so changes can be rolled back if needed

### Real-time Updates
Ensure configuration changes can be deployed without system restarts

## Key Technical Considerations

The system should store configurations in a structured format (JSON schemas) that can be interpreted at runtime. Business rules should be expressed as configurable parameters rather than code, with the application acting as an execution engine for these configurations.

This approach allows the business to adapt to new requirements, customer needs, and market conditions without requiring development cycles, while maintaining the flexibility to add new configuration options through code when entirely new capabilities are needed.

## Cannabis Industry Specific Considerations

### Compliance & Regulatory
- **State Compliance**: Configure state-specific regulations and compliance requirements
- **License Management**: Track and validate dispensary licenses and compliance status
- **Product Restrictions**: Manage product availability based on local regulations
- **Tax Configuration**: Handle complex cannabis tax structures (excise, state, local)

### Wholesale Operations
- **Minimum Order Quantities**: Configure MOQs for different product categories
- **Bulk Pricing Tiers**: Set up volume-based pricing for wholesale customers
- **Territory Management**: Define exclusive territories and distributor relationships
- **Product Allocation**: Manage inventory allocation between internal and external dispensaries

### Quality & Testing
- **COA Management**: Configure Certificate of Analysis requirements and validation
- **Batch Tracking**: Set up lot tracking and traceability requirements
- **Quality Standards**: Define quality thresholds and testing requirements
- **Recall Procedures**: Configure automated recall notification systems
